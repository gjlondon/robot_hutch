# Robo-Rabbit Hutch

Conway's Game of Life implemented using RabbitMQ to communicate between cells.
 
To run:

1. Make sure you have rabbitMQ installed and running on the default port

2. (Probably make and enter a virtualenv then)

`pip install requirements.txt`

3. 

`python main.py`

For your computer's sake, stick to boards of less than 15 cells-to-a-side.
